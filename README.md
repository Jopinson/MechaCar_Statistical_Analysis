# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
My boss, Jeremy was approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. Using the R programming languge we were able to preform a varity of statistaical tests on the dataset to determine the best model for our MechaCars! There are 50 different MechaCar models that we tested. 
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The first study we conducted was a linear regression that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from our dataset.

The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance, and the intercept.
